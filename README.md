# Fake-news-prediction
This project aims to predict whether a news article is fake or real using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset containing labeled news articles.

# Libraries Used :
NumPy: For numerical computing.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NLTK: For natural language processing tasks such as text preprocessing.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning modeling and evaluation.
re: For regular expression operations.

# Usage:
* Preprocess the data.
* Data analysis
* Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
* Train the model using the training set.
* Evaluate the model using the testing set.
* Predict the authenticity of news articles for new data points.
